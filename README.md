# Dannys Documentation
This is a repository meant to describe in detail the personal projects I do that are not on Github. I try to keep all files here up to date, so if you find an issue or a section that is out of date please let me know.

## Usage
This is just a detailed walkthrough of installation and setup of different systems.
Please look at the folder and file name to understand what each doc is about.
